One is placed in the center as the devotee's preferred God, Ishta Devata, and the other four in a square around it. Kumara, often added as a sixth Deity, is generally situated behind the Ishta Devata. Philosophically, all are seen by Smartas as equal reflections of the one Saguna Brahman, rather than as distinct beings. This arrangement is also represented in Smarta temples, with one in a central sanctum, and the others installed in smaller shrines. Each God may be worshiped in any of His\/Her traditional aspects or incarnations, allowing for much variety (e.g., Shakti as Lakshmi, Vishnu as Rama, and Siva as Bhairava). With the addition of the sixth Deity, Kumara, the system is known as shanmata, \"sixfold path.\" This system has laid the foundation for the modern secular or neo-Indian religion, in which Hindus freely add Jesus, Mother Mary, Mohammed, Buddha or other holy personages to their altars.

Papa includes all forms of wrongdoing, from the simplest infraction to the most heinous crime, such as premeditated murder. Each act of papa carries its karmic consequence, karmaphala, \"fruit of action,\" for which scriptures delineate specific penance for expiation. Those who have awakened psychic sight can clearly see papa in the inner subconscious aura as a colorful, sticky, astral substance. Papa is seen as dark unrelated colors, whereas its counterpart, punya, is seen as pastels. The color arrangements are not unlike modern art murals. Papa colors can produce disease, depression, loneliness and such, but can be dissolved through penance (prayashchitta), austerity (tapas) and good deeds (sukritya). There are specific consequences, karmaphala, \"fruit of action,\" that result from each type of transgression of dharma. For example, a man who steals from his neighbors creates a cosmic debt which may be repaid later by having his own possessions taken away. There are also specific penances, prayashchitta, that can be performed for atonement and the accrual of punya (merit) to balance out the papa, the negative karma of the wrongful act. Such disciplines are provided in the various Dharma Shastras and prescribed by knowing preceptors, panditas, shastris, swamis, yogis and village elders according to the varna and education of the individual. For example, the Laws of Manu give several types of penance for the crime of murder, including 1) making a forest hut and subsisting there on alms for twelve years and using a human skull as one's emblem; or 2) walking 100 yojanas (900 miles), while reciting the Vedas, eating little and remaining continent. A contemporary example: if a man fells a large healthy tree, he may atone by planting ten trees and ensuring that at least one grows to replace it. The degree of papa accrued from an action depends on various factors, including the karma, dharma and spiritual advancement of the individual, the intent or motivation, as well as the time and place of the action (for example, unvirtuous deeds carry great demerit when performed in holy places). Papa is the opposite of punya (merit, virtue).

An act of devotion (bhakti), austerity (tapas) or discipline (sukritya) undertaken to soften or nullify the anticipated reaction of a past action. Penance is uncomfortable karma inflicted upon oneself to mitigate one's karmic burden caused by wrongful actions (kukarma). Consciously relieving the karmic burden of wrongful actions by undergoing physical or mental hardships and challenges. It includes such acts as prostrating 108 times, fasting, self-denial, or carrying kavadi (public penance), as well as more extreme austerities, or tapas. Penance is often suggested by spiritual leaders and elders. Penitence or repentance, suffering regret for misdeeds, is called anutapa, meaning \"to heat.\" -- bala tadayati prayashchitta: \"Child-beating penance,\" performed to mitigate the papa, sometimes called sin, accrued by having beaten a child. First, the adult counts the number of slaps or hits -- with cane, stick, strap, hand, or fist -- that he (or she) administered to children in the past. Then he meditates on the extent of harm he caused and in what ways. He lets the reality of this live with him for a week or two. (He may, at first, deny it, rationalize it, explain it away to himself, tell himself that there are a dozen reasons why striking a child was necessary, useful, customary and therefore acceptable. But all is Siva, and no violence toward another human being, let alone our own flesh and blood, is acceptable.) Once acceptance is complete, while looking into a large mirror, he administers upon his own body five hits for each one he gave to a child, with hand, cane, belt, etc., in the exact area of the body where the hurt was felt by the child. This may take time, and it should be painful. Thus, looking in the mirror, he slaps himself five times for every slap he gave each child, pinches himself five times for every pinch given, etc. After this phase of the prayashchitta has been completed and the abuser feels much relieved of the heavy karmas, the abuser must 1) apologize to all the children he has abused and assure them that he will no longer ever use corporal punishment, but instead use positive discipline. 2) Then he assures the children under his influence that he will protect them from such brutality at home and in school. 3) Next, he writes to his satguru or other mentor about his penance, indicating if the guilt has passed and inner peace has returned. He includes a handwritten pledge, vrata, stating: A) that he will never inflict such abuse ever again; and B) that he will notify the school that children must be treated with respect and kindness and receive no beating of any kind, and that any misbehavior by children under his care should be reported to him by teachers so that appropriate discipline can be administered at home. 4) Once the mentor responds, the penance is complete. -- pushpa prayashchitta: \"Flower penance.\" Those who have been physically abused are as much in need of penance to mitigate the experience as are those who abused them. Each person -- child or adult -- who has been beaten at any time, no matter how long ago, is enjoined to put up in the shrine room a picture of the person or persons by whom they were beaten, be it a father, mother or teacher. Then, every day for thirty-one days, he or she places a flower in front of each picture and, while doing so, sincerely forgiving the person in heart and mind. If no picture is available then some symbol or possession can be substituted, or even a paper with the name written on it. -- krodha prayashchitta: \"Anger penance.\" Anger arises from the second chakra below the muladhara, the vitala chakra, and when that force center begins to vibrate, it vibrates in many different ways, spinning counterclockwise, causing disturbance to the natural shanti that otherwise prevails. Below are the some of the various faces of anger that the vitala chakra gives rise to. For each, a monetary sum is paid to compensate, as a form of penance, for allowing oneself to sink into this hurtful, unwholesome state of mind. Angry emotions that are suppressed: US$.10. Raising one's voice to emphasize a point: $.25. Pouting and turning the head away: $.50. Saying unkind things, unnecessary snide remarks: $.75. Sharp comments uttered in a raspy voice: $1.00. Long, brooding silences (an expression of anger that appears peaceful but is a way of cutting a person out of one's life): $2.00. (Mental arguments happen during those silences, deafening silences, loud deafening silences, during which thought swirls around how to retaliate or refute the other person's point.) A deeply cutting remark or hurtful insinuation or criticism of a personal nature: $2.50. A long, angry dissertation as to how others are totally wrong and how matters cannot continue in this way any longer: $4.00. An angry rage in which the aura turns black-red, or a jealous outburst in which one emphasizes, \"I am in command. You are the serfs. You obey me, because you fear me.\" Or \"You are wrong, and I don't like you. You did something terrible, unforgivable, stupid...(and such hateful things)\" $5.00. For the wealthy, each of these amounts can be doubled; for the very wealthy, quadrupled. A jar labeled \"Krodha Prayashchitta\" is established in the shrine room to receive the payments. The sum collected is sent to a charity on the first Sunday of each month.

Prakriti is the manifesting aspect, as contrasted with the quiescent unmanifest -- Purusha, which is pure consciousness. In Shaktism, Prakriti, the active principle, is personified as Devi, the Goddess, and is synonymous with Maya. Prakriti is thus often seen, and depicted so in the Puranas, as the Divine Mother, whose love and care embrace and comfort all beings.

A term especially used in Vaishnavism to name a concept extremely central to virtually all Hindu schools. In Saiva Siddhanta, bhakti is all important in the development of the soul and its release into spiritual maturity. The doctrine is perhaps best expressed in the teachings of the four Samayacharya saints, who all shared a profound and mystical love of Siva marked by 1) deep humility and self-effacement, admission of sin and weakness; 2) total surrender in God as the only true refuge and 3) a relationship of lover and beloved known as bridal mysticism, in which the devotee is the bride and Siva the bridegroom. The practice of yoga, too, is an expression of love of God in Saiva Siddhanta, and it is only with God's grace that success is achieved. Rishi Tirumular states: \"Unless your heart melts in the sweet ecstasy of love -- my Lord, my treasure-trove, you can never possess\" (Tirumantiram 272). It is in this concept of the need for self-effacement and total surrender, prapatti, that the members of all sects merge in oneness, at the fulfillment of their individual paths. Similarly, they all meet in unity at the beginning of the path with the worship of Lord Ganesha.

During puja, the officiant (pujari) recites various chants praising the Divine and beseeching divine blessings, while making offerings in accordance with established traditions. Puja, the worship of a murti through water, lights and flowers in temples and shrines, is the Agamic counterpart of the Vedic yajna rite, in which offerings are conveyed through the sacred homa fire. On special days additional offerings are made, and as part of the puja, abhishekam or ritual bathing of the Deity is often performed as well. Items blessed during the ceremony, known as prasadam or sacraments, are distributed to the attendant devotees after the rite. Puja is also performed to one's guru.

Also central are pranayama (breath control), guru vandana (adoration of the preceptor), nyasa (empowerment through touching) and mudra (mystic gestures). Puja offerings also include pushpa (flowers), arghya (water), tambula (betel leaf) and chandana (sandalpaste). -- atmartha puja: Karana Agama, v. 2, states: Atmartha cha parartha cha puja dvividhamuchyate, \"Worship is twofold: for the benefit of oneself and for the benefit of others.\" Atmartha puja is done for oneself and immediate family, usually at home in a private shrine.  -- parartha puja: \"Puja for others.\" Parartha puja is public puja, performed by authorized or ordained priests in a public shrine or temple.

Punya includes all forms of doing good, from the simplest helpful deed to a lifetime of conscientious beneficence. Each act of punya carries its karmic consequence, karmaphala, \"fruit of action\" -- the positive reward of actions, words and deeds that are in keeping with dharma. Awakened psychics who have developed clairvoyant sight can clearly see the punya accrued in the inner subconscious aura as a colorful, free-flowing, astral, light-energy, pranic substance. Punya is seen as light-hued, pastel colors, whereas its counterpart, papa, is seen as shades of darker colors which are usually static and immovable. These variegations of the papa shades and punya hues are not unlike the free-expression paintings found in modern art. Punya colors produce inner contentment, deep joy, the feeling of security and fearlessness. Papa can be dissolved and punya created through penance (prayashchitta), austerity (tapas) and good deeds (sukritya). Punya is earned through virtuous living, following the multi-faceted laws of dharma. Punya depends on purity of acts according to various factors including 1) the karma and evolution of the individual, 2) degree of sacrifice and unselfish motivation and 3) time and place. For example, virtuous deeds, sadhana, tapas and penance have greater merit when performed in holy places and at auspicious times. The Tirukural (105) states that \"Help rendered another cannot be measured by the extent of the assistance given. Its true measure is the worth of the recipient.\" In other words, a small act done for a great and worthy soul carries more punya than even a large act performed for a lesser person.

Purity and its opposite, pollution, are a fundamental part of Hindu culture. While they refer to physical cleanliness, their more important meanings extend to social, ceremonial, mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual cleanliness or contamination. Freedom from all forms of contamination is a key to Hindu spirituality, and is one of the yamas. Physical purity requires a clean and well-ordered environment, yogic purging of the internal organs and frequent cleansing with water. Mental purity derives from meditation, right living and right thinking. Emotional purity depends on control of the mind, clearing the subconscious and keeping good company. Spiritual purity is achieved through following the yamas and niyamas, study of the Vedas and other scriptures, pilgrimage, meditation, japa, tapas and ahimsa. Ritual purity requires the observance of certain prayashchittas, or penances, for defilement derived from foreign travel, contact with base people or places, conversion to other faiths, contact with bodily wastes, attending a funeral, etc. Purity is of three forms -- purity in mind, speech and body, or thought, word and deed. Purity is the pristine and natural state of the soul. Impurity, or pollution, is the obscuring of this state by adulterating experience and beclouding conceptions. In daily life, the Hindu strives to protect this innate purity by wise living, following the codes of dharma. This includes harnessing the sexual energies, associating with other virtuous Hindu devotees, never using harsh, angered or indecent language, and keeping a clean and healthy physical body.

A synonym for atman. Purusha can also refer to the Supreme Being or Soul, as it sometimes does in the Upanishads. In the Rig Veda hymn \"Purusha Sukta,\" Purusha is the cosmic man, having a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet and encompassing the Earth, spreading in all directions into animate and inanimate things. In the Sankhya system, Purusha is one of two supreme, beginningless realities: spirit and matter, Purusha and Prakriti, the male and female principles. It is the quiescent unmanifest, pure consciousness, contrasted with Prakriti, the manifesting, primal nature from which the cosmos unfolds. In Saiva cosmology, purusha is the 25th of 36 tattvas, one level subtler than prakriti. Beyond these lie the subtle realms of shuddha maya. Transcending all the tattvas is Parashiva.

This includes pursuit of truth under a guru of a particular parampara and sampradaya. Dharma is of four primary forms. It is the steady guide for artha and kama. See: dharma.  -- artha: \"Wealth.\" Material welfare and abundance, money, property, possessions. Artha is the pursuit of wealth, guided by dharma. It includes the basic needs -- food, money, clothing and shelter -- and extends to the wealth required to maintain a comfortable home, raise a family, fulfill a successful career and perform religious duties. The broadest concept of wealth embraces financial independence, freedom from debt, worthy children, good friends, leisure time, faithful servants, trustworthy employees, and the joys of giving, including tithing (dashamamsha), feeding the poor, supporting religious mendicants, worshiping devoutly, protecting all creatures, upholding the family and offering hospitality to guests. Artha measures not only riches but quality of life, providing the personal and social security needed to pursue kama, dharma and moksha.
