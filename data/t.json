Tapas is extreme bodily mortification, long-term sadhanas, such as meditating under a tree in one place for 12 years, taking a lifetime vow of silence and never speaking or writing, or standing on one leg for a prescribed number of years. Scriptures generally warn against extreme asceticism which would bring harm to the body. 2) On a deeper level, tapas is the intense inner state of kundalini \"fire\" which stimulates mental anguish and separates the individual from society. Life does not go on as usual when this condition occurs. The association with a satguru, Sadashiva, brings the devotee into tapas, and it brings him out of it. The fire of tapas burns on the dross of sanchita karmas. This is the source of heat, dismay, depression and striving until the advent of final and total surrender, prapatti. The individual can mollify this heated condition by continuing his regular sadhana as outlined by the guru.

Lord Siva constantly creates, sustains the form of and absorbs back into Himself His creations. Rishis describe this emanational process as the unfoldment of tattvas, stages or evolutes of manifestation, descending from subtle to gross. At mahapralaya, cosmic dissolution, they enfold into their respective sources, with only the first two tattvas surviving the great dissolution. The first and subtlest form -- the pure consciousness and source of all other evolutes of manifestation -- is called Siva tattva, or Parashakti-nada. But beyond Siva tattva lies Parashiva -- the utterly transcendent, Absolute Reality, called attava. That is Siva's first perfection. The Sankhya system discusses 25 tattvas. Saivism recognizes these same 25 plus 11 beyond them, making 36 tattvas in all. These are divided into three groups: 1) First are the five shuddha (pure) tattvas. These constitute the realm of shuddha maya 2) Next are the seven shuddha-ashuddha (pure-impure) tattvas. These constitute the realm of shuddhashuddha maya. 3) The third group comprises the 24 ashuddha (impure) tattvas. These constitute the realm of ashuddha maya. THE SUDDHA TATTVAS: Actinic or spiritual energy. This is the superconscious realm, also known as shuddha (pure) maya or mahamaya. Bindu, transcendent light, is the \"material\" cause of this pure sphere. This is the Sivaloka, the region of the 330 million Gods, the myriad rishis and other beings who have attained freedom from the triple bondage. 1) Siva  tattva: \"auspiciousness,\" of two parts: the higher is Parashakti, \"Supreme Energy,\" from which emerges primal sound, nada (more precisely Paranada, soundless sound). Though most often referred to as sound, nada is more mystically known as movement, the first impulse arising from perfect quiescence, the first \"thing\" out of the motionless Self. This is Siva's second perfection, Parashakti, superconsciousness, the mind of God. The Siva tattva pervades all other 35 categories and possesses the powers of will, knowledge and action (icchha, jnana, kriya). 2) Shakti  tattva: energy, corresponds to bindu, light, the cause of form (more precisely Parabindu, primal nucleus). This is the tattva of Parameshvara, the Primal Soul, father-mother God, Siva's third perfection, who after mahapralaya remains transfixed in deep samadhi, until He again emanates the universe through His Cosmic Dance. 3) Sadashiva  tattva: the power of revealing grace. In this realm the energies of knowledge and action are in perfect equilibrium. This is the realm of the anandamaya kosha. 4) Ishvara  tattva: the energy of concealment, concealing grace. The energy of action prevails over that of knowledge in order to arouse cosmic activity in its subtle form. 5) shuddhavidya tattva: pure knowledge, dharma. This is a level of manifestation in which the energy of action is in abeyance and the energy of knowledge prevails. Shuddhavidya tattva includes Siva's other three powers or aspects: Rudra (destruction), Vishnu (preservation) and Brahma (creation). -- THE SUDDHASUDDHA TATTVAS: Actinodic, or spiritual-magnetic, energy. The seven tattvas from maya to purusha make up the shuddhashuddha (pure-impure) realm. 6) maya tattva: mirific energy, the \"material\" cause of the \"impure sphere.\" The category of maya brings into being as its immediate aids the following five tattvas, known as the \"five sheaths,\" pancha kanchuka, of the individual soul, purusha. Collectively they make up the vijnanamaya kosha, or mental body. 7) kala tattva: the phenomenon of time, which divides all experience into past, present and future. 8) niyati tattva: karmic destiny; necessity; order; law of cause and effect; restraint. 9) kala tattva: creativity, aptitude, the power which draws the soul toward spiritual knowledge. Its energy partially removes the veil of anava which clouds the inherent powers of the soul. 10) vidya tattva: limited knowledge, the power which gives the soul practical knowledge in accord with its present life experiences. 11) raga tattva: attachment, the arousal of desire, without which no experience of the objective world is possible. 12) purusha tattva: soul identity; soul connected with subjectivity. Through identification with the five above \"sheaths,\" the soul, atman, becomes a purusha, or bound soul, capable of experiencing the higher Antarloka as a limited individual. This fivefold sheath is called the pancha kanchuka, or vijnanamaya kosha (mental body). -- THE ASUDDHA TATTVAS: Odic, or magnetic, energy. These 24 categories make up the \"world\" of ashuddha (impure) maya. This is the realm of the astral and physical planes, in which souls function through the manomaya, pranamaya and annamaya koshas, depending on their level of embodiment. 13) prakriti tattva: primal nature, the gross energy of which all lower tattvas are formed. Prakriti, also called pradhana, is expressed as three gunas (qualities) -- sattva, rajas and tamas. These manifest as light, activity and inertia, respectively; and on the subtle level as pleasure, sorrow and delusion. These gunas dominate the soul's powers of knowledge, action and desire (jnana, kriya and icchha), and form the guna body, manomaya kosha. -- antahkarana: the mental faculty. 14) buddhi tattva: judgment, intellect, the faculty of discrimination. 15) ahamkara tattva: egoism, sense of I-ness in the external form. It is the fundamental principle of individuality. 16) manas tattva: the instinctive mind, the receiving and directing link between the outer senses and the inner faculties.  -- jnanendriya: the five cognitive senses, of the nature of sattva guna. Each has a subtle and physical aspect. 17) shrotra tattva: hearing (ears). 18) tvak tattva: touching (skin). 19) chakshu tattva: seeing (eyes). 20) rasana tattva: tasting (tongue). 21) ghrana tattva: smelling (nose).  -- karmendriya: the five organs of action, of the nature of raja guna. Each has a subtle and physical aspect. 22) vak tattva: speech (voice). 23) pani tattva: grasping (hands). 24) pada tattva: walking (feet). 25) payu tattva: excretion (anus). 26) upastha tattva: procreation (genitals).  -- tanmatra: the five subtle elements, of the nature of tamaguna. 27) shabda tattva: sound. 28) sparsha tattva: feel. 29) rupa tattva: form. 30) rasa tattva: taste. 31) gandha tattva: odor. These are the subtle characteristics of the five gross elements, akasha, vayu, tejas, apas and prithivi, respectively. -- panchabhuta: the five gross elements. 32) akasha tattva: ether or space. 33) vayu tattva: air. 34) tejas tattva: fire. 35) apas tattva (or jala): water. 36) prithivi tattva: earth.

The three-world cosmology is readily found in Hindu scriptures. In the major Upanishads of the Vedas we find numerous instances, with interesting variations. Verse 1.5.17 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states, \"Now, there are, verily, three worlds, the world of men (Manushyaloka), the world of the fathers (Pitriloka) and the world of the Gods (Devaloka)...\" Later, verse 6.2.15 refers to the two higher worlds as the Devaloka and the Brahmaloka. The Katha Upanishad, verse 2.3.8, omitting the world of men, lists the Pitriloka, the Gandharvaloka (world of genies or elementals) and the Brahmaloka (world of God). Another perspective of three worlds is offered in the Prashna Upanishad 3.8, which lists the world of good (Punyaloka), the world of evil (Papaloka) and the world of men (Manushyaloka). Scriptures offer several other cosmological perspectives, most importantly seven upper worlds (sapta urdhvaloka) and seven lower worlds (sapta adholoka), which correspond to the 14 chakras and make up the \"world-egg of God,\" the universe, called Brahmanda. The seven upper worlds are Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka. The second, third and fourth comprise the subtle plane. The highest three comprise the causal plane. The seven lower worlds, collectively known as Naraka or Patala, are (from highest to lowest) Put, Avichi, Samhata, Tamisra, Rijisha, Kudmala and Kakola. From the Saiva Agamic perspective of the 36 tattvas, the pure sphere, shuddha maya -- the first five tattvas -- is subdivided into 33 planes of existence. The \"pure-impure\" realm, shuddhashuddha maya -- the seven tattvas from maya tattva to purusha -- contains 27 planes of existence. The ashuddha (\"impure\") realm -- of 24 tattvas -- has 56 planes of existence.

As the Agamas themselves are now partially lost, the Tirumantiram is a rare source of the complete Agamanta (collection of Agamic lore). Its 3,047 verses were, as legend has it, composed in a rather extraordinary way. Before writing each verse, Tirumular would meditate for an entire year, then summarize his meditation in a four-line Tamil verse. He did this for 3,000 years! The allegory is said to mean that 3,000 years of knowledge is compacted in this one book. The text is organized in nine parts, called tantras, summarized as follows: 1) basic rules of religious morality; 2) allegorical explanations of Saiva mythological stories; five powers of Siva, three classifications of souls; 3) a complete treatise on raja yoga; 4) mantras and tantras; 5) the essential features of the Saiva religion; the four forms of Saivism, four stages, unorthodox paths, conduct to be avoided; 6) the Sivaguru, grace, renunciation, sin, penance, jnana, worthy and unworthy persons; 7) siddha yoga, more on grace, mudras, control of ida and pingala, worlds reached by different classes of yogis after death, refinements of yoga, the satguru; 8) essential theology: five sheaths, eleven states, three padarthas (Pati-pashu-pasha), 36 tattvas, four states of consciousness, three malas, three gunas, ten karanas, etc.; 9) the fruits of realization, liberation, jnana, Siva's dances, meeting of the guru.

It is an acknowledgement by faithful Hindus of God's providential care, bringing a greater awareness of God's power in the world.

Here, changing or transforming the sexual\/instinctive energies into intellectual and spiritual ones. Transmutation means to reverse the forces that constantly flow from the sahasrara downward into the muladhara. It is lifting the force of sexual impulses that would tend to manifest in visualization, longing for affection and sensual feelings, often leading to masturbation and loss of the sacred fluids. One exception, for both men and women, is the occurrence of wet dreams,for here the astral, psychic vitality of the actinodic rises as the odic fluids are released. However, night emissions are to be controlled and may be minimized or eliminated by taking only liquid or light foods in the evening.Swami Sivananda discusses wet dreams in his Yoga Lessons for Children, chapter 36 on brahmacharya: \"Many young boys and men suffer from wet dreams. Sri Aurobindo states that an occurrence once a week is normal. To have it more frequently indicates indulgence in sex thoughts.\" Sivananda advises a sattvic diet, rising early (as wet dreams usually occur in the last quarter of the night), cold showers, hatha yoga, fresh fruit and raw foods, and not going to bed right after a heavy meal. He writes, \"The actual essence does not come out during wet dreams. It is only the watery prostatic juice, with a little semen. When nocturnal emission takes place, the mind which was working in the inner astral body suddenly enters the physical body vehemently in an agitated condition. That is the reason why emission takes place suddenly.\" He concludes, \"Do not get depressed or anxious. It is best not to give too much importance to these dreams. Forget them, then they will not trouble you.\" Monks enhance transmutation by not eating after high noon, not viewing pornography, not mentally conjuring up sexually stimulating images, never joking or talking about sexuality and, of course, not flirting or interacting sensually with women or men. If sexual energies are aroused or one has erred from his disciplines, he performs the appropriate penance (such as fasting) or tantra (such as pranayama) to correct the matter.
